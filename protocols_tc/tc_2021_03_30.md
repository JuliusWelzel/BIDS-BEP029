# BIDS Maintainers group meeting- BEP 029 Update
*Minutes for 30.03.2021*

__Present__: Sein Jeung, Julius Welzel, Stefan Appelhoff, Chris Markiewicz, Kay Robbins, Ross Blair,Remi Gau, Franklin Feingold

n the following the most important point from a call between the above mentioned members are summarised. An update on the current situation of the [BEP029](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iaaLKgWjK5pcISD1MVxHKexB3PZWfE2aAC5HF_pCZWo/edit) was given and open questions were adressed by the committee members .

## Terminology
Tracking System - A system which is recording motion data independent of other systems
Tracked Point - A specific point on an object that is being tracked, which can be a body part or an inanimate object. (Count in *_motion.json, name & label in *_channels.tsv)
Axis - Refers to the axis along which the Cartesian coordinates are defined in case of position data, or an axis around which sequences of rotations are applied (Euler angles)
Coordinate system - should be present if possible, otherwise some global space?

## **_motion.json** files
**Problem:**
Motion data is often recorded using multiple recording devices with potentially different sampling rates from each other - this results in multiple .tsv files specific to a device or sometimes an entire recording system.

**Approach:**
Introduce objects in **_motion.json** in filed tracking systems. Each object has similar to other BIDS device keywords. Try examples where grouping is done by type of recording.

## **_channels.tsv** files
**Problem:**
Multiple tracking systems from the _motion.json have multiple channel files.

**Approach:**
One single channels.tsv file which contains all relevant information including tracked point, axis-component and placement.
